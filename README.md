# Parliament

Parliament is intended to help you surface more interesting content and reduce
annoyance in a busy set of twitter feeds. Having several accounts or following
active twitter users can make it easy to miss interesting content;  parliament
can help by applying various text processing techniques such as naive bayesian
filtering, clustering and scoring. It's very much a work in progress.
